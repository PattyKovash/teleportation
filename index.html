				<p>Teleportation has been successfully completed in real life. No joke.</p>
				<p>Through "spooky action at a distance", science fiction became science fact.</p>
				<p>Spooky action at a what?! Hey, those were Einstein's words, not mine.</p>
				<p>If you know the phenomenon behind this breakthrough,</p>
				<p>you may agree with such a description. Einstein was referring to...</p>
				<p>Quantum entanglement. Stay with me now. It's going to get weird.</p>
				<p>Imagine 2 objects. We can decide if they'll be either blue or red.</p>
				<p>These two objects are bound to eachother. They're partners.</p>
				<p>BUT until we decide, both randomly &amp constantly change between red &amp blue.</p>
				<p>Let's leave one object on earth &amp send the other 50 million light years away to space.</p>
				<p>Yes, 50 MILLION light years. But, it could be 50 trillion or quadrillion and beyond.</p>
				<p>Ok, now we're ready to decide their fate.</p>
				<p>Let's make the object on earth blue. Now let's take a look at the object in space.</p>
				<p>Wait...what?! The object in space is red, but we didn't decide on it's color yet...</p>
				<p>Ok, let's redo this. 2 new objects please.</p>
				<p>We'll start with the object in space this time. Let's make it blue.</p>
				<p>Now let's go back to the object on earth. Do you know where this is going...?</p>
				<p>Hmm...the object on earth is red...even though we didn't decide on its color yet.</p>
				<p>And however many times we repeat this experiment, the same thing will happen.</p>
				<p>When the fate of one object is decided,</p>
				<p>the fate of the other is instantaneously decided to be the opposite.</p>
				<p>Make one blue, the other becomes red.</p>
				<p>Or make one spin clockwise and the other will have a counterclockwise spin.</p>
				<p>Regardless of the distance, the transfer of information is seemingly instant.</p>
				<p>This state change of the partner object happens faster than the speed of light.</p>
				<p>Faster than the speed of light? But isn't that impossible? Nope, not in quantum physics.</p>
