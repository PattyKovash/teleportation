				<p>Teleportation has been successfully completed in real life. No joke.</p>
				<p>Through "spooky action at a distance", science fiction became science fact.</p>

				<p>If you know the phenomenon behind this breakthrough,</p>
				<p>you may agree with such a description.</p>
				<p>Einstein was referring to quantum entanglement.</p>
